## Backstory: The Great EU Pizza Scandal 🍕🇪🇺

It all started in Brussels, in what the media now calls The Great Pizza Scandal of 2027.

For years, a few massive online pizza‑ordering platforms had quietly taken over the market. Almost every pizza in Europe — from a Naples Neapolitan to a Finnish reindeer‑topped pie — was ordered through the same two or three apps.

Then came the investigation.  
EU regulators discovered that these platforms were:
- Charging hidden “oregano taxes” to restaurants
- Replacing real mozzarella with “digitally enhanced cheese‑like product” in photos
- Using AI to auto‑swap your order to “whatever was cheapest for them that day”
- Secretly ranking Brussels‑style endive‑and‑anchovy pizza as “Most Popular” in all countries

The final straw came when the platforms accidentally declared pineapple pizza an EU cultural heritage dish.

The public outrage was immediate. MEPs debated for 14 hours straight.  
One impassioned speech ended with the now‑famous line:

> “We must take back control… slice by slice!” 🍕

The result: **EU Regulation 2028/PI‑ZZ‑A**  
Centralized pizza ordering was banned.  
Every pizzeria must now run its own independent ordering system — no shared apps, no shady algorithms, no pineapple unless you really want it.

**That’s where you come in.**  
Mamma Mia’s Pizza has hired you to build their database‑driven ordering system so they can thrive in this brave new post‑scandal pizza economy.
