# Project Description

You will work in two connected layers:

## 1. Database Layer
- Design an ERD
- Create a relational schema with constraints
- Populate tables with realistic data
- Write SQL queries and transactions to answer the restaurant‚Äôs needs

## 2. Programming Layer
- Small console program (or minimal web UI)
- Uses SQL queries to:
	- Display menu
	- Place orders
	- Apply discounts
	- Assign delivery drivers
	- Generate staff reports

---

## Deliverables

At the end of the 6 weeks, you will submit:
- Final ERD (PDF or image)
- SQL schema (CREATE TABLE statements with constraints)
- Sample data (INSERT statements)
- SQL queries (reports, discounts, advanced queries, transactions)
- Program source code (Java, Python, or another approved language)
- Video presentation (5‚Äì10 min)

> This project is designed for 2 people. Please go to the People page in Canvas and join a group with another student.

---

## Video Presentation Requirements

Your only graded submission is a recorded presentation (max 10 minutes) in which you:
- Introduce your project
- Explain your database design using your ERD
- Show the database in action
- Run a few SQL queries directly in your DB client
- Demonstrate your application:
	- Place an order, apply a discount, assign a driver
	- Show at least two staff reports
	- Highlight transactions and constraints
	- Show what happens if invalid data is inserted
- Conclude with what you learned

You may use screen recording + voiceover or appear on camera if you wish.

## ‚úÖ Project Functional Specification Checklist

### üçï Core Features (Required)

#### üìã Menu & Pricing
- Menu displays pizzas, drinks, and desserts from the database
- Pizzas are linked to ingredients (many-to-many)
- Pizza price is calculated dynamically:
	- Ingredient costs
	- 40% margin
	- 9% VAT
	- No price column is stored directly in the pizza table
- Vegetarian/vegan labels are shown based on ingredients

#### üßë‚Äçüíº Customer & Order Management
- Customers can be added with full info (name, birthdate, address, etc.)
- Orders can be placed with:
	- One or more pizzas (mandatory)
	- Optional drinks and desserts
- Order confirmation includes all items and total price

#### üéÅ Discounts & Loyalty
- Customers get 10% off after 10 pizzas (tracked over time)
- One-time discount codes can be redeemed (only once)
- On their birthday, customers get:
	- 1 free pizza (cheapest)
	- 1 free drink
- Discounts are applied dynamically in SQL or application logic

#### üöö Delivery Assignment
- Delivery personnel are assigned to postal codes
- Orders are assigned to a delivery person based on customer‚Äôs postcode
- A delivery person becomes unavailable for 30 minutes after delivery
- Delivery status is tracked and visible

#### üìä Reports (Staff Interface)
- Undelivered orders are displayed
- Top 3 pizzas sold in the past month
- Earnings reports filtered by:
	- Gender
	- Age group
	- Postal code

#### üîÑ Database Transactions & Constraints
- Placing an order is wrapped in a transaction
- Rollback occurs if any part of the order fails
- Constraints are enforced:
	- Vegetarian pizzas don‚Äôt contain meat
	- Valid date of birth
	- Ingredient costs are > 0
	- Discount codes are unique and single-use

---

### ‚ú® Bonus Features (Optional but encouraged)

#### üí° Database Design & Querying
- Use views to encapsulate logic (e.g. menu with prices, veg filters)
- Use stored functions/procedures (e.g. for price calculation, discount logic)
- Create and use indexes to optimize slow queries
- Use check constraints creatively to enforce business rules

#### ‚è± Time & Temporal Logic
- Use timestamps to manage:
	- Delivery timing
	- Order cancellation window (e.g., cancel within 5 minutes)
- Monthly/weekly sales queries use SQL date/time functions

#### üß™ Testing & Data Generation
- Generate realistic test data using SQL scripts or Python tools (e.g. Faker)
- Include at least 20 sample orders across different timeframes

#### üõ°Ô∏è Design Thinking & Security (Discussed or Implemented)
- Discussed or implemented access control ideas (e.g. staff vs customer)
- Prevented obvious forms of misuse or data entry mistakes

---

## üé• Final Video Presentation (All Parts are Required)

Make sure your final video:
- Shows your ERD and explains your design
- Demonstrates placing an order and applying a discount
- Shows pizza price calculation working correctly
- Shows at least 2 staff reports running live
- Shows 1 transaction in action (including rollback if you dare)
- Ends with a reflection on what you learned or what surprised you

## Week-by-Week Plan

### Week 1 ‚Äì Data Modeling & Project Kickoff
**Goals:**
- Understand the project context (EU pizza scandal)
- Identify main entities and relationships
- Normalize the data model
- Practice writing ER diagrams

**Activities:**
- Read project brief + backstory
- Identify functional requirements
- Create ERD with:
	- Pizza, Ingredient, Customer, Order, OrderItem, DeliveryPerson, DiscountCode
- Apply normalization principles
- Discuss how pizza pricing will be calculated dynamically

**Deliverables:**
- ER diagram
- Written description of business rules (discount logic, delivery constraints)

---

### Week 2 ‚Äì Schema Design & Database Connection in Code
**Goals:**
- Convert ERD into a relational schema
- Implement the schema with proper constraints
- Set up code to interact with the database

**Activities:**
- Write SQL CREATE TABLE statements
- Add primary keys, foreign keys, CHECK constraints, and uniqueness conditions
- Connect your application (Python, Java, etc.) to the database
- Run a simple SELECT query from code

**Deliverables:**
